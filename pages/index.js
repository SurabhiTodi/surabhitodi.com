      <p>I'm a writer and marketer who likes to understand how people work. I try to engage in both theory and practice, which means I'm always cycling between writing to understand a topic, then finding ways to test those ideas in the "real world."

I'm currently interested in memestock communities and meme-based economies. 

Previously, I founded a social e-commerce site for pre-owned clothing called [Clothwrks.com](http://clothwrks.com), working to help solve the crises of fast fashion waste we currently face. Recently I have been consulting with startups on growth and product strategy, fundraising and achieving product market fit.

I occasionally write on this website ([RSS](https://nadiaeghbal.com/feed.xml)), and I also publish my [notes](https://nadiaeghbal.com/notes/) every month. For future updates, you can sign up for my [monthly newsletter](https://nayafia.substack.com/), where I share my writing, TikTok videos, and anything interesting I've read.
