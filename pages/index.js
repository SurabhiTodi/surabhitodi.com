      <p>I'm a writer and marketer who likes to understand how people work. I try to engage in both theory and practice, which means I'm always cycling between writing to understand a topic, then finding ways to test those ideas in the "real world."</p>

I'm currently interested in meme-based economics- the ultimate form of marketing. I'm also interested in the attention economy- or how companies can profit off of people's attention.

<p>Previously, I founded a social e-commerce site for pre-owned clothing called <a href= "http://clothwrks.com">Clothwrks.com</a>, working to help solve the crises of fast fashion waste we currently face. Recently I have been consulting with startups on growth and product strategy, fundraising and achieving product market fit.

I occasionally write on this website. For future updates, you can sign up for my <a href= "http://eepurl.com/g1hwXL">newsletter</a>, where I share my writing, TikTok videos, and anything interesting I've read.
